# Material Colors

Sizes from [Google's Material Design
](https://material.io/design/layout/responsive-layout-grid.html#breakpoints)
made available to coders.

The sizes are scraped from the guide. The idea to publish sizes in multiple forms is
stolen from [shuhei/material-colors](https://github.com/shuhei/material-colors).

## Available Forms

- JSON: Raw data of sizes.
- JavaScript: Sizes set object provided via AMD, CommonJS or global variable `materialSize`.
- EcmaScript module: Sizes variable is exported.

## Usage

### Download

Download what you like from [dist directory](dist) and use it.

### NPM

```
npm install material-sizes
```

### Yarn

```
yarn add material-sizes
```
